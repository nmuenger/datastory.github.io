## Why this matter 
A survey conducted on two thousand British adults showed that people watch TV for 78â€™000 hours on average in their lifetime. This number shows that movies have a significant role in our society. We also think that representativity is a crucial factor to achieve an inclusive society. For example, main characters of movies can act as role models and inspire young generations. We believe that representativity has been neglected in the past but interestingly, people seem to be more and more concerned about this issue. Therefore, we want to characterize the distribution of gender and ethnicity across movie characters. We also want to analyze the evolution of representativity in time to understand if the movie industry is going in the right direction. Finally, we will infer how the public and critics react to diversity by analyzing the critics review and box office revenue of movies.
